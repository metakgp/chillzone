TARGET: get first-year.csv directly

1. Get Timetable Pdf            ->            STEP 3 (ABORTED...STEP 2 NOT COMPLETED)
    i. write scraper to login erp
    ii. ask scraper to get timetable

2. Convert it into excel        ->            STEP 2 (ONGOING...SEEMS NO EASY SOLUTION)
    i. write scraper to get smallpdf.com to convert from pdf to excel -> NOT A GOOD IDEA(NO POINT IN INSTALLING BROWSER IN SERVER)
    ii. research this: https://solidframework.net/ (mind behind smallpdf.com) -> DAMNN TOO EXPENSIVE 🤯🤯🤯
    iii. handling manually is the best way to do this

3. Formatting Excel             ->            STEP 1 (DONE!)
    i. Locate sheets with first year timetables :: LOCATE EAA IN SPECIFIC LOACTIONS (FIRST YEAR IS NOT WRITTEN IN ALL -> PARSING ERROR)
    ii. sanitize sheets to remove heading so that all are equal :: GET Time/Day AT A1 FOR EASY PROCESSING OF NEXT STEP
    iii. get a map to connect times to slot number :: MANUAL GENERATION
    iv. manipulate excel to get data with mapping slot->room :: LEARN ~PYEXCEL
    v. find api to get subject details from subject name of first years :: TRY GETTING ACCESS TO HERCULES
    ---location: slots->room->subject with details---
    vi. restructure data to get first_year.csv
