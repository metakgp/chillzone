      <h3>Understanding Classroom Availability: Rules and Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        1. Timetable Accuracy: Empty classrooms are based on the official
        timetable provided by the institution's ERP system. Professors might
        occasionally change classrooms without updating the ERP, leading to
        discrepancies between the listed and actual locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Guard Access: Even if a classroom is empty according to the
        timetable, it might not always be accessible. Guards have the discretion
        to unlock or keep classrooms locked based on various factors, ensuring
        security and maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Maintenance and Unforeseen Circumstances: Classrooms can be
        unavailable due to maintenance, unexpected events, or other unforeseen
        circumstances. Such situations might not be immediately updated in the
        system, leading to discrepancies.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Real-Time Updates: The system might not always reflect real-time
        changes. It's advisable to confirm the availability with the
        institution's staff if you need a classroom urgently.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Room Reservation Policies: Some classrooms might be reserved for
        specific purposes, such as meetings, events, or exams, even if they
        appear empty in the timetable. It's important to adhere to the
        institution's room reservation policies when planning to use a
        classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Flexibility and Communication: Flexibility is key when planning to
        use a classroom. Always have a backup location in mind in case your
        preferred classroom is unavailable. Communication with relevant
        authorities, such as administrative staff or professors, can help in
        securing a suitable classroom for your needs.
